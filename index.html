			<p>It was the first visit with their new farrier. He asked the young artist who was about 8 or 9 at the time, "Do you have a phone?" She answered, "No". "Do you have an iPad?" She answered "no". He turned to his friend and said, "I like this kid." Growing up in rural America, without the distractions of electronic gadgets, she was drawing before she could write. Reagan could often be found drawing horses and wildlife at homr or at her "Pop and Nanny's" ranch.</p>
			<p>Her grandmother, also known as Nanny, called one night and said, "I just read that the Cowboy Hall of Fame has a student western art contest. Reagan is always drawing horses--she needs to enter one of them in the contest."</p>
			<p>She was working on an oil painting of two people riding horses near a lake. With the deadline approaching she worked hard to finish it by the deadline. At 12 she entered the contest and not only won her age group but the Best of Show. This award included a scholarship to the Western Art Academy and Prix de West Seminars. Reagan had no idea there were so many people who also liked to draw and paint the western way of life! She listened to western artists talk about their craft and looked at all the beautiful paintings which portray what’s good about the American West. The best part was the scholarship to the Western Art Academy with William Whitaker. The youngest artist in the class, Mr. Whitaker was so nice to help and encourage her to pursue her passion for art.</p>
			<p>Her other passion is studying, riding and training horses. Her favorite accomplishment with her horses is training a young horse from yearling to three-year old. She won a state 2-year old training competition and is now training her to compete in ranch classes and all-around classes in 4-H.</p>
			<p>Now a teenager she sketches or paints daily. Reagan studies with a local artist and takes every opportunity she can to learn from the masters in the western art world. She’s active in 4-H, FFA, National Reining Horse Youth Association and Foundation Quarter Horse Association. Her goals include becoming a veterinarian specializing in equine lameness and a Prix de West artist someday.</p>
			<p>Reagan’s current works include oil and pencil. Many of her works are of people or horses she knows and loves. She sells greeting cards with prints of her paintings. She also designs and sells horsehair jewelry and keychains. If you have a favorite horse or a horse that has passed on she can make a custom bracelet or keychain with your special horse’s hair. A portion of the proceeds she receives from selling her art is donated to the 4-H Foundation which has afforded her so many opportunities.</p>
