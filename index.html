			<p>It was the first visit with their new farrier. He asked the young artist who was about 8 or 9 at the time, "Do you have a phone?" She answered, "No". "Do you have an iPad?" She answered "no". He turned to his friend and said, "I like this kid." Growing up in rural America, without the distractions of electronic gadgets, she was drawing before she could write. Reagan could often be found drawing horses and wildlife at home or at her "Pop and Nanny's" ranch.</p>
			<p>Her grandmother, also known as Nanny, called one night and said, "I just read that the Cowboy Hall of Fame has a student western art contest. Reagan is always drawing horses--she needs to enter one of them in the contest."</p>
			<p>At 12 she entered the contest and not only won her age group but the Best of Show. This award included a scholarship to the Western Art Academy and Prix de West Seminars. Reagan had no idea there were so many people who also liked to draw and paint the western way of life! The best part was the scholarship to the Western Art Academy with William Whitaker. The youngest artist in the class, Mr. Whitaker was so nice to help and encourage her to pursue her passion for art.</p>
			<p>Now a teenager, she sketches or paints daily. Reagan studies with a local artist and takes every opportunity she can to learn from the masters in the western art world including William Whitaker, Andrew Peters, and Loren Entz. Reagan’s current works include oil and pencil drawings. Many of her works are of people or horses she knows and loves. She sells greeting cards with prints of her paintings. She also designs and sells horsehair jewelry and key chains. If you have a favorite horse or a horse that has passed on she can make a custom bracelet or keychain with your special horse’s hair. A portion of the profits she receives from selling the horsehair bracelets is donated to the Healing Heroes with Horses Jinx McCain Horsemanship program sponsored through the Semper Fi Fund. The program pairs wounded veterans with quarter horses to help them heal.</p>
